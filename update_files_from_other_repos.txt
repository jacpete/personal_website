# and copy updated files to the new directory so that the website stays updated

# to copy over. It will contian the following columns:
  * user - Github username for the repo
  * repo - What repo is the file from?
  * oriFileLoc - Relative file location for the file inside the repo directory
  * websiteFileLoc - Relative directory for the file inside the website repo
