My career has given me experience applying a broad range of statistical and spatial methodologies and honed me into expert in R programming and working with GIS.
Academic research has prepared me  to think critically, learn new skills independently and quickly, manage complex projects, and collaborate within teams to achieve results.
I enjoy exploring datasets, solving the puzzles that accompany analysis, and transforming raw data into the solutions used to answer important questions.  
I am currently looking for a data science position that allows me to solve pragmatic problems while leveraging my skills in data management, GIS, and statistical analysis.
