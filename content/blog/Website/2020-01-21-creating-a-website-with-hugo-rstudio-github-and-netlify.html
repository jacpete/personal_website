<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have been thinking about creating a website for a few years to showcase the projects I am working on and create a blog where I can make my work more accessible to others.
I wanted to start my blog out with a post describing how I set up my website.</p>
<p>After exploring a few places to host a website (<a href="https://www.weebly.com/">weebly</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>) and testing out a couple static website generators, I decided to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> with the popular <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/">Academic Theme</a>.
My reason for choosing this route was to follow a well traveled road with plenty of available support through documentation and forums while also choosing an option that allows lots of customizability.</p>
<div id="software-requirements-and-suggestions" class="section level2">
<h2>Software Requirements and Suggestions</h2>
<p>All the software needed can be installed across all major operating systems (Linux, macOS X, and Microsoft Windows).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GitHub</strong> account - This will be used to make your website code available to Netlify to host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Netlify</strong> account - I choose to sign in with my GitHub credentials because you have to give Netlify access to your GitHub account anyways to manage your repo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hugo</strong> - This is the static website generator program. It can easily be installed and updated using the <strong>R</strong> package <code>blogdown</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> is optional and your website could be managed entirely without them, but the <code>blogdown</code> R package with RStudio Add-ins will make your life a lot easier and I use these programs in my instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atom Text Editor</strong> is optional but I use it when writing large text blocks for because it has spell check added in, while current versions of RStudio do not (that is changing in the upcoming release of RStudio 1.3).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="suggested-reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Suggested Reading</h2>
<p>A lot of what I learned to complete my website build came from the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown book</a> by <a href="https://yihui.org">Yihui Xie</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io">Amber Thomas</a>, and <a href="https://alison.rbind.io">Alison Presmanes Hill</a> on creating a website in RStudio using the <code>blogdown</code> R package. It has an entire chapter dedicated to introducing new users to <strong>Hugo</strong> and discusses how to deploy your site using <strong>Netlify</strong>. I also highly recommend having a general workng knowledge of Markdown and/or RMarkdown.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<div id="initializing-your-website-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Initializing your Website Repository</h2>
<p>The Academic Hugo theme has a wonderful <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/">help guide</a> describing how to install the theme with various methods. I chose the recommended method and was happy with the result and will share it with you here. This method uses Netlify to create a repository for your website on GitHub with all the basic materials needed to get started creating your own website. Netlify as a hosting service will automatically provide you with a customizable sub-domain URL or allow to to link to your own domain.</p>
<p>Follow the link to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart">Deploy and Academic Site with Netlify</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/netlifyDeploy.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the Connect to GitHub link and login with your GitHub credentials.</p>
<p>Change the Repository name to anything you want. I called mine <code>personal_website</code>. And click <em>Save and Deploy</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/websiteName.png" /></p>
<p>The best thing about creating your base website with this method, is that all the basic Netlify configuration is done for you and your website will deploy without effort on your part.
A new page will load that contains your websites’ settings and its current randomly generated URL.
Mine here is <code>https://determined-allen-0ba60a.netlify.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/initialNetlify.png" /></p>
<p>If you click that link, you will be taken to your website, which will look something like this.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/initialWebsite.png" /></p>
<p>The next thing you may be wondering though is how to change the URL to your website from that crazy generated one.
Netlify makes this easy as well.</p>
<p>If you go back to the landing page for your websites’ settings you can click the site settings button under the URL that took you to your website. From there you can change your sub-domain with the change site name button.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/changeNetlifySubdomain2.png" /></p>
<p>Now you can use the updated custom sub-domain to get top your website.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can set a custom domain name. Using the link labeled ‘<em>Set up a custom domain</em>’ on the landing page for your websites settings. This allows you to use your own domain name you already own, or you can buy a domain through Netlify and they configure DNS settings and provide a security certificate for you.</p>
<p>I personally don’t know at the moment how difficult that is to manage yourself, so I chose the simplest solution and bought a domain name from Netlify.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/newDomain.png" /></p>
<p>You now have a website with a nice custom URL that will be much easier for people looking for it to find or remember.</p>
<p><br>
<br></p>
<p>But where is this data all stored? It deploys from the GitHub repository that you created. If you head on over to your GitHub, you will find the repository you named in the initial steps with all the data for your website.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/initialGithub.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-rstudio-with-a-local-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up RStudio with a Local Repository</h2>
<p>Now that you have a basic website deployed, you need a way to edit it. <strong>RStudio</strong> and the <code>blogdown</code> package make this a much simpler process by providing an interface to interact with a GitHub hosted remote repository. If you have never worked with Git or GitHub before, it may be helpful to read up on it a little bit as that is out of the scope of this blog post.</p>
<div id="cloning-the-repository" class="section level3">
<h3>Cloning the Repository</h3>
<p>This tutorial assumes you have set up SSH authentication between your computer and GitHub. This is easily done using RStudio and you can find a tutorial on how to complete this <a href="/blog/using-rstudio-with-github/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To add a new GitHub project, go to the project drop down on the top-right corner of your RStudio window and click <em>New Project</em></p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/rstudioNewProject1.png" /></p>
<p>This opens a new window with a few options. Because you are hosting your website in a GitHub repository we are inherently using version control with <strong>Git</strong>. Confirm that your choices in the next two windows reflect that.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/rstudioNewProject2.png" /></p>
<p>Finally retrive the SSH clone URL for your website repository from GitHub and copy it into the final New Project window in RStudio.
Make sure it saves to the directory you want and click <em>Create Project</em>.
The repo will then clone itself into the new directory and open up as an RStudio project.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/rstudioNewProject3.png" /></p>
<p>Congratulations you now have a local version of your website repository that you can customize.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-dependencies" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing Dependencies</h3>
<p>Now that your website is in a local folder on your computer, it is time to finish installing all the other local dependencies that you will need to make editing your website easier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="blogdown-package" class="section level4">
<h4><code>blogdown</code> package</h4>
<p>Install the blogdown package with the following code in RStudio.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&#39;blogdown&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This package provides helpful functions and add-ins that will make editing your website easier.</p>
<img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/blogdownAddins.png" />
<p align="center">
blogdown Add-ins
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="hugo" class="section level4">
<h4>Hugo</h4>
<p>Install the latest version of Hugo with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code></pre>
<p>However, you could also install the version of Hugo that Netlify is currently using by checking the netlify.toml file from the root of your website repository:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/netlifyHugoVersion.png" /></p>
<p>Then specify which version of Hugo you want to install.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_hugo(version = &quot;0.60.1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-theme-for-hugo" class="section level4">
<h4>Academic Theme for Hugo</h4>
<p>The Academic theme is attached to the repo using a git submodule. To add local access, go to a terminal (like the one built into RStudio using the <em>Terminal</em> tab next to the <em>Console</em>) and type the following commands:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>#Enter the working directory for the project
cd ~/GitHub/personal_website

#Download git submodules within your project
git submodule update --init --recursive</code></pre>

<div id="customizing-the-website" class="section level1">
<h1>Customizing the Website</h1>
<p>Now you have all the tools you should need to start customizing your own personal website.
This customization can be as simple filling in your information and rearranging the home page to act your personal online business card, or involve heavy customization of themes and multipage navigation. For the purpose of this blog post, I will only run through the important details to get you a functioning personalized one page website, but check out my <a href="/categories/website/">other blog posts</a> where I go into detail on how I customized my own site.</p>
<div id="config.toml" class="section level3">
<h3>config.toml</h3>
<p>Located at ’/config/_default/config.toml, I changed the following settings from their default:</p>
<ul>
<li>title = “Jacob Peterson”
<ul>
<li>This changes the main title of your webpage in the browser tab and the left hand side of the navigation bar on the header.
<img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/configTitle.png" alt="Title" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>copyright = “© Jacob Peterson, 2020”
<ul>
<li>Adds a copyright notice to the footer of the website. If you want to display the current year in a date range like ‘2019-2020’, insert ‘2019-{year}’.
<img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/configCopyright.png" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>theme = “academic”
<ul>
<li>If you installed with this guide through the academic theme website, this should already be filled in correctly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>enableGitInfo = true
<ul>
<li>This enables the last modified date for posts to be filled in from GitHub automatically.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="params.toml" class="section level3">
<h3>params.toml</h3>
<p>Located at ’/config/_default/params.toml, I changed the following settings from their default:</p>
<ul>
<li>site_type = “Person”
<ul>
<li>I chose person because this is a personal site, but look into the other options if you are making this site for a lab group, business or organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>highlight = true
<ul>
<li>Enables text highlighting in markdown code chunks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>highlight_languages = [“r”,“bash”,“css”]
<ul>
<li>Adds support for highlighting these specific languages. Many more can be added here. Add what you will use in your website and blog posts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>highlight_style = “atom-one-dark”
<ul>
<li>Here you can change the highlight style for your code chunks. I use the ‘One Dark’ theme from atom a lot so I chose to include it in my website. Explore <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/">cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/</a> for more choices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>math = true
<ul>
<li>I foresee myself using LaTex math on some of my pages and decided to enable it as a global option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comment out edit_page options to prevent visitors from editing pages</li>
<li>Contact Details: Fill them out with whatever information you want to include in the contact widget. Here is a snippet of what mine looks like:

<li>
I chose to not use the default email option so that I could have better control over how the link is set. If you want to use an email form, fill in your email with the default email option. You may get an error if you set your email to a blank string stating: <em>‘Please set an email address for the contact form using the <code>email</code> parameter in <code>params.toml</code>. Otherwise, set <code>email_form = 0</code> to disable the contact form.’</em> To fix this ensure the <code>email_form</code> option in the ‘/content/home/contact.md’ file is set to 0.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<pre class="md"><code>+++
# Contact widget.

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
I also wanted to provide a quick note about how to set custom contacts links like I did with the email link. Academic supports font packs from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/">Font Awesome</a> and <a href="https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/">Academic Icons</a>. You can go to those websites, find the icon you wish to use and insert its name as the <code>icon</code>. The <code>icon_pack</code> defines whether it is from font awesome <em>fa*</em>), or from academic icons (<em>ai</em>). The <code>name</code> is what it will display on the page and the <code>link</code> is where it will direct you to. You can add in links to other pages of your website by naming them from the root of your website like <code>'/posts'</code>. or directing to another widget on the page like <code>'#contact'</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>main_menu = {align = “r”, show_logo = true}
<ul>
<li>I moved the main menu to the right side of my header for personal aesthetics.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="edit-author-biography-on-the-homepage" class="section level3">
<h3>Edit Author Biography on the Homepage</h3>
<p>As I am making this a personal website I want the biography on the homepage to display my own information, not the fictional information of HBO’s Silicon Valley’s Neslon Bighetti.
<img src="/blog/Website/2020-01-21-creating-a-website-with-hugo-rstudio-github-and-netlify_files/authorOriginal.png" />
To do this, edit the ‘<em>/content/authors/admin/_index.md</em>’ file. This is just a markdown file with special options in the YAML portion that the contact widget uses to fill in the widget template. The main text of the document represents the actual biography paragraph. An example of what mine looks like copied below.</p>
<pre class="md"><code>---

My career has given me experience applying a broad range of statistical and spatial methodologies and honed me into expert in R programming and working with GIS.
Academic research has prepared me  to think critically, learn new skills independently and quickly, manage complex projects, and collaborate within teams to achieve results.
I enjoy exploring datasets, solving the puzzles that accompany analysis, and transforming raw data into the solutions used to answer important questions.
I am currently looking for a data science position that allows me to solve pragmatic problems while leveraging my skills in data management, GIS, and statistical analysis.</code></pre>

<div id="edit-files-in-home-folder-to-specify-what-widgets-are-shown" class="section level3">
<h3>Edit files in home folder to specify what widgets are shown</h3>
<p>You may have also noticed a bunch of other widget sections on your homepage that you may want to alter or turn on an off. The place to start with this is in the ‘<em>/content/home</em>’ folder. This folder contains a bunch of markdown documents that define what widgets (or sections) will be displayed on your homepage. We have already looked at the <em>contact.md</em> file earlier in this tutorial. All of these documents have a few default options in the header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>widget</code> - Name of the widget template that you want to call. By default these are found in ‘<em>/themes/academic/layouts/partials/widgets</em>’. You likely aren’t going to change unless you start customizing widget templates.</li>
<li><code>headless</code> - TRUE/FALSE. Is this widget just a section on the page. Most likely going to keep this as true.</li>
<li><code>active</code> - TRUE/FALSE. Whether this widget should be displayed. The most common setting you will change.</li>
<li><code>weight</code> - An integer that gives weight to where the section will be displayed on the page. Lower numbers get displayed closer to the top and large numbers go closer to the bottom.</li>
<li><code>title</code> - Title on the widget</li>
<li><code>subtitle</code> - Subtitle on the widget</li>
</ul>
<p>Some documents have additional options that are defined. These options are used by specific widgets to customize and fill in additional information. For these special widgets, you can just follow the examples and comments and fill in your own information.</p>
</div>
<div id="menu.toml" class="section level3">
<h3>menu.toml</h3>
<p>Located at ’/config/_default/menu.toml, this is where you change what links you want to display in your header. In a one page site these will likely just include a lot of reference links like ‘<em>#contact</em>’, but you have it link to other webpages as well.
Similar to configuring your home page content, the <code>weight</code> is relative for the order that the links appear in the document, <code>name</code> refers to the display name in the header, and <code>url</code> is the link location.</p>
</div>
<div id="add-custom-icon-for-your-site." class="section level2">
<h2>Add custom icon for your site.</h2>
<p>Find a png icon that you want to use as your sites icon in the browser tab. It seems as though the only restriction is that it needs to be 512x512 pixels. Once you have the icon you want to use save it to ’/assets/images/icon.png`. See more information <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/#website-icon">here</a>.</p>
